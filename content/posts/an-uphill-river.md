A few weeks ago, just after four cops murdered George Floyd and kicked off the biggest series of major protests in this country that I can remember, I saw [a tweet](https://twitter.com/IwriteOK/status/1265517983524433923?s=20) from Robert Evans:

This has been rattling around in my brain ever since. Obviously he was onto something - whether or not a second wave of the pandemic is building and waiting to break over us in the coming months and retake the spotlight, the current BLM movement is at least as consequential and could (should!) lead to real changes in how we permit police to operate (or, preferrably, *not* to operate).

And that's good - I hope, desperately, that it *does* become that defining story.

But the other thought that's creaking floorboards and rattling blinds in the back of my mind is that it's entirely possible that it's neither of those things. *If* it's something else, I have an idea of what it might be.

So, look, when the economy cratered in 2007 and the government had no choice but to swoop in and "save the day", there were two major responses: TARP (Bush) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and auto bailouts (Obama). In retrospect, even liberals who took part in, for example, the oversight panels in charge of preventing misuse of those considerable funds reflect on these responses with regret. 

The government failed to use its *absolute leverage* in the situation to achieve any meaningful changes that would either ameliorate the economic misery of average Americans or prevent corporations from benefiting from the disaster they created. It didn't even make a commensurate return on the immense risk it took on. Just, you know, truly pathetic all around.

**But right now, what's been done so far in response to the pandemic is worse, and it's not even close.**

I am no great prognosticator. I'm wrong all the time! But, sandwiched between a pandemic and great civil unrest, the upward transfer of wealth that the former has enabled might define the conditions of this abominable time more than any other one thing. It's going to touch everything, from how Americans remember the pandemic itself to the extent to which civil unrest expands beyond its current expression. 

If the total funds made available by the federal government in the CARES act had been dispersed equally to every adult in the country, it'd be close to $25k per person. If it just went to the labor force, it'd be over $37k.

The max anyone will recieve is $1200. Many will receive less, or none. Many of those who don't get anything will be the most vulnerable, rather than the already wealthy.

Ultimately, what has just happened is an utterly unprecedented financial operation to enrich the wealthy at the expense of the many. It's a gushing river, flowing uphill. TARP and ARRA pale in comparison, not only in terms of real numbers, but in the context. The lack of oversight is more egregious. The "concessions" for corporations receiving bailout money are essentially nonexistent. Literally - one man, with no accountability, can waive restrictions unilaterally.

And, yes, there are complicated factors to this - the Fed is able to leverage loan guarantees up to 10x for certain kinds of fiscal stimulus, so it's not like they just printed a few trillion bucks and said "sorry, poor people can't have these", but these mechanisms are flexible and *could* be used to drive more equitable financial responses, if those in power so desired.

I would argue that these details are, anyway, entirely academic. The central premise is impossible to ignore, monolithic. If the Great Recession didn't entirely extinguish average Americans' hope that they weren't, in fact, abandoned, than this will. The stock market is strong, surging, while double-digit unemployment percentages linger and new cases of coronavirus tick back into dangerous territory. 

How else will that be explained, other than to acknowledge that the markets no longer reflect the economy that most of us live in?

How could that be so, unless one was rescued and the other was not?

The markets aren't irrational right now - they reflect reality quite clearly. If you are poor or precarious, which is a stunning plurality in this country, you are alone. If you are a corporation, you may receive tremendous windfalls with one hand while laying off workers with the other. 

This state of affairs is amenable to both parties. There is no "good guy" coming to save the day, and if all this does is stoke your despair about a dang cheeto in the white house, you're a rube. I believe this astounding coup will be at the forefront of the surfeit of analyses to come examining this time and its consequences.
