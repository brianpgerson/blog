And a bit about me, sure.

I'm Brian - I do, among other things, software engineering work at Square. I also happen to have **extreme online brain poisoning** re: politics. So: technical subjects and political comments will be the meat and potatoes here. Seems like a good way to make any reader stopping by upset, if not outraged. Cool!
